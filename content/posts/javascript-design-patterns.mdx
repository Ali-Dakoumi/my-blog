# 🔁 Functional Programming Design Patterns in JavaScript (With Real Examples)

## 🧭 Introduction

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, meaning you can write object-oriented, procedural, or functional code. But with first-class functions, closures, and higher-order constructs, JavaScript is exceptionally suited for functional programming.

This article covers essential functional design patterns in JavaScript—patterns rooted in FP theory and proven in real-world codebases.

## 📚 Key Functional Concepts

Before diving into the patterns, it's essential to understand the core principles of functional programming:

- ✅ **Pure Functions**: No side effects, same output for the same input
- 🚫 **Immutability**: Data is never mutated; instead, new data is returned
- 🔁 **Function Composition**: Combining smaller functions into larger ones
- 🎭 **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take or return functions
- 📦 **Closures**: Inner functions that remember the scope in which they were created

## 🧠 1. Pure Function Pattern

A function is pure if its output is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects.

❌ **Impure:**

\`\`\`javascript
let count = 0;

function increment() {
count += 1; // Side effect: modifies outer variable
return count;
}
\`\`\`

✅ **Pure:**

\`\`\`javascript
function increment(value) {
return value + 1;
}
\`\`\`

Why it matters: Pure functions are easier to test, debug, and reason about.

## 🔁 2. Function Composition Pattern

Build complex functionality by chaining simple functions together.

Example:

\`\`\`javascript
const toUpper = str => str.toUpperCase();
const exclaim = str => str + '!';
const repeat = str => str + str;

const compose = (...fns) => input =>
fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), input);

const screamTwice = compose(repeat, exclaim, toUpper);

console.log(screamTwice("hello")); // HELLO!HELLO!
\`\`\`

This pattern is declarative and eliminates intermediate state.

## 🔧 3. Higher-Order Function (HOF) Pattern

A function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function.

Example: Custom map function

\`\`\`javascript
function map(arr, transformFn) {
const result = [];
for (let el of arr) {
result.push(transformFn(el));
}
return result;
}

const doubled = map([1, 2, 3], x => x \* 2); // [2, 4, 6]
\`\`\`

Used widely in:

- React (e.g., `useEffect`, `useCallback`)
- Array methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- Express middlewares

## 🧳 4. Currying Pattern

Transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single argument.

Without Currying:

\`\`\`javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
return a \* b;
}
multiply(2, 3); // 6
\`\`\`

With Currying:

\`\`\`javascript
function curriedMultiply(a) {
return function (b) {
return a \* b;
};
}

const double = curriedMultiply(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10
\`\`\`

Or using arrow functions:

\`\`\`javascript
const curriedMultiply = a => b => a \* b;
\`\`\`

Use Case: Useful for creating reusable, partially applied functions.

## 🪢 5. Partial Application Pattern

Fix a number of function arguments and return a new function with fewer arguments.

Example:

\`\`\`javascript
function greet(greeting, name) {
return `${greeting}, ${name}`;
}

function partial(fn, ...fixedArgs) {
return function (...remainingArgs) {
return fn(...fixedArgs, ...remainingArgs);
};
}

const sayHello = partial(greet, "Hello");

console.log(sayHello("Alice")); // Hello, Alice
\`\`\`

Common in middleware configuration, UI event handling, or currying variants.

## 🧱 6. Immutability Pattern

Never modify existing data—always return new versions.

❌ **Mutation:**

\`\`\`javascript
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
user.age = 26; // mutation
\`\`\`

✅ **Immutable:**

\`\`\`javascript
const updatedUser = { ...user, age: 26 };
\`\`\`

For arrays:

\`\`\`javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const newNumbers = [...numbers, 4]; // [1, 2, 3, 4]
\`\`\`

Libraries like Immer, Immutable.js, and Ramda help enforce immutability in large codebases.

## 🔁 7. Recursion Pattern

Replace loops with self-calling functions for iteration, often more functional.

Example: Sum of array

\`\`\`javascript
function sum(arr) {
if (arr.length === 0) return 0;
return arr[0] + sum(arr.slice(1));
}

console.log(sum([1, 2, 3, 4])); // 10
\`\`\`

Used in algorithms (tree traversal, flattening nested structures).
Tip: Use tail recursion or memoization for performance.

## 📦 8. Lazy Evaluation Pattern

Delay computation until the result is actually needed.

Example using generators:

\`\`\`javascript
function\* infiniteNumbers() {
let num = 0;
while (true) {
yield num++;
}
}

const numbers = infiniteNumbers();
console.log(numbers.next().value); // 0
console.log(numbers.next().value); // 1
\`\`\`

This pattern saves memory and improves performance when working with large or infinite data sets.

## ⚙️ 9. Declarative Pipeline (Monad-like Pattern)

Chain operations in a declarative pipeline using `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`.

\`\`\`javascript
const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = data
.filter(n => n % 2 === 1)
.map(n => n \* 2)
.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

console.log(result); // 18
\`\`\`

This is essentially the Functor + Reducer monad pattern in action.

## 🧩 10. Maybe Pattern (Safe Null Handling)

Avoid null/undefined errors by wrapping values in a container.

\`\`\`javascript
const Maybe = value => ({
map: fn => (value == null ? Maybe(null) : Maybe(fn(value))),
getOrElse: fallback => (value == null ? fallback : value)
});

const result = Maybe("hello")
.map(str => str.toUpperCase())
.map(str => str + " world")
.getOrElse("default");

console.log(result); // HELLO world
\`\`\`

Similar to Optional in Java or Option in functional libraries like folktale or sanctuary.js.

## 🔚 Conclusion

Functional programming design patterns are not just academic—they’re practical, elegant solutions to everyday problems in JavaScript. They lead to:

- ✅ Safer, more predictable code
- 📏 Easier testing and debugging
- 🚀 Enhanced code reusability and modularity

Start small: refactor functions to be pure, favor immutability, and use built-in HOFs like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`. As your codebase grows, patterns like composition, currying, and Maybe will make your life easier.
